Hugh Howey, just like the creators of "24", doesn't realize that "debrief" is not the same as "brief".<br />

David Mitchell<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>in "Ghostwritten": spouts lame pseudo-science; misspells "Anichkov" as "Anchikov"; and - best of all - uses "theosophy" instead of "theology";</li>
<li>in "The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet": states that original Psalms are in Aramaic; they are not.</li>
</ul>
