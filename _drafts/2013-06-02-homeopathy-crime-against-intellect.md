"Что могут понимать врачи?"

"Это - работает: вот целая книга, и к тому же, автор - врач!"

"Гомеопатия, конечно, бред, но народная медицина - другое дело.
Народ веками проверял, что работает, а что - нет.
Например, в Индии."

А как насчёт того, что в Индии все поголовно пользуются гомеопатией?
Они её уже проверили и у них работает?
Или через пару сотен лет они подведут, наконец, итоги, и перестанут ей пользоваться?
Или через 100 лет я услышу, что гомеопатия работает, раз ей пользуются в Индии?
Или я уже сейчас это услышу?

"Это - натурально."

Как сказала борчиха против атомных электростанций, когда её спросили, проверила ли она свой подвал на радон.

"От антибиотиков один вред. Организм сам знает, как справиться."

Но почему-то часть организма ответственная за удаление отходов, не справляется со соей задачей, и надо вымывать
килограммы дерьма (полные, естественно, паразитов).

R. A. Heinlein; "Assignment in Eternity"

"We defined thinking as integrating data and arriving at correct answers. Look around you. Most people do that stunt
just well enough to get to the corner store and back without breaking a leg. If the average man thinks at all, he does
silly things like generalizing from a single datum. He uses one-valued logic. If he is exceptionally bright, he may use
two-valued, 'either-or' logic to arrive at his wrong answers. If he is hungry, hurt, or personally interested in the
answer, he can't use any sort of logic and will discard an observed fact as blithely as he will stake his life on a
piece of wishful thinking. He uses the technical miracles created by superior men without wonder nor surprise, as a
kitten accepts a bowl of milk. Far from aspiring to higher reasoning, he is not even aware that higher reasoning exists.
He classes his own mental process as being of the same sort as the genius of an Einstein. Man is not a rational 
animal; he is a rationalizing animal."

"For explanations of a universe that confuses him he seizes onto numerology, astrology, hysterical religions, and other
fancy ways to go crazy. Having accepted such glorified nonsense, facts make no impression on him, even if at the cost of
his own life. Joe, one of the hardest things to believe is the abysmal depth of human stupidity."

...

"Here and there among ordinary men is a rare individual who really thinks, can and does use logic in at least one
field—he's often as stupid as the rest outside his study or laboratory—but he can think, if he's not disturbed or sick
or frightened. This rare individual is responsible for all the progress made by the race; the others reluctantly adopt
his results. Much as the ordinary man dislikes and distrusts and persecutes the process of thinking he is forced to
accept the results occasionally, because thinking is efficient compared with his own meanderings."

"Still rarer is the man who thinks habitually, who applies reason, rather than habit pattern, to all his activity.
Unless he masques himself, his is a dangerous life; he is regarded as queer, untrustworthy, subversive of public morals."
 
...
 
"Rarest of all is the man who can and does reason at all times, quickly, accurately, inclusively, despite hope or fear
or bodily distress, without egocentric bias or thahnic disturbance, with correct memory, with clear distinction between
fact, assumption, and non-fact."

...</span>they can't learn what they must know."

"It's up to us to brief them. Their hearts are all right; tell them the score—they'll come down with the right answers."
 
"No, Joe. We've tried it; it does not work. ... Reason is poor propaganda when opposed by the yammering, unceasing lies
of shrewd and evil and self-serving men. The little man has no way to judge and the shoddy lies are packaged more
attractively. There is no way to offer color to a colorblind man, nor is there any way for us to give the man of
imperfect brain the canny skill to distinguish a lie from a truth."
