https://shulchanaruchharav.com/the-adherence-of-not-making-kiddush-during-the-seventh-hour/

- quote Alter Rebbe
- quote the Rebbe's letters from Igros and Likkutei Sichos
- wrong statement about Alter Rebbe's opinion - shaot zmaniot
- wrong unsourced opinion about 6 by the clock - contradicts, not supported by, the Rebbe's letter
- late kiddush on Yom Tov also can be a problem
