Scala has <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cayhorstmann/archive/2010/05/16/xml-processing-scala">very good</a> support for XML, including built-in XML parser and access to the platform-provided parsers.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the documents that need to be parsed are in HTML, and XML parsers can not handle that, since the rules of element nesting and attribute values are different. <a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">TagSoup</a> package by John Cowan is designed to bridge the gap. The question is: how to hook TagSoup into Scala's XML parsing?<br />
<br />
Google search came back with two relevant results: <a href="http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/How-to-use-TagSoup-with-Scala-XML-td1940874.html#a1940874">How to use TagSoup with Scala XML?</a> and <a href="http://www.hars.de/2009/01/html-as-xml-in-scala.html">Processing real world HTML as if it were XML in scala</a>, both by Florian Hars.<br />
<br />
Unless I am missing something, at least in Scala 2.8 there is a simpler solution:<br />
<pre class="brush: scala">  import scala.xml.{Elem, XML}
  import scala.xml.factory.XMLLoader
    
  import org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup.jaxp.SAXFactoryImpl
    
    
  object TagSoupXmlLoader {
    
    private val factory = new SAXFactoryImpl()
  
    
    def get(): XMLLoader[Elem] = {
      XML.withSAXParser(factory.newSAXParser())
    }
  }
</pre><br />
Strictly speaking, the class is not needed; one-liner <br />
<pre class="brush: scala">XML.withSAXParser(new org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup.jaxp.SAXFactoryImpl().newSAXParser())
</pre>is all it takes! But, the object provides the scope where to put the code that configures features of the SAXFactoryImpl if such a need ever arises :)<br />
