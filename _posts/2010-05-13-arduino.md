I became a late adopter of a number of technologies (among them - [LTSP](http://ltsp.org/), Google Apps and
[XQuery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery)) in a similar way. A technology looks interesting when I encounter it for
the first time. It keeps popping up for years. I think it is not for me. Then, a problem arises, and that particular
technology turns out to be *the* solution.

Finally, the same happened to [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/). I knew about it. It used an unfamiliar word
"[microcontroller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller)". And usually robots were involved, and I am not into
robots :) I ignored it; not any more. Here is my story so far.

### The Problem ###

Recently, I decided to look into a way to trigger my photo camera when a drop of water breaks a (laser?) beam. Or -
[capture a mouse in flight](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2009/03/building-better-mousetrap.html). Or a bursting balloon.
Or a growing flower. While researching this problem, I kept [bookmarking](http://delicious.com/leonid/electronics) (on
[delicious](http://delicious.com/), of course) various sites. That is why I know *when* it brought me face-to-face with
Arduino. It started on April 21st, 2010.

I found two commercial devices designed for automating photography I saw them mentioned in photography books (for
instance, in an excellent [Mastering Canon EOS Flash Photography](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Canon-EOS-Flash-Photography/dp/193395244X/)
by NK Guy). One is called [Stop Shop](http://www.cognisys-inc.com/), and it costs
[$300](http://www.cognisys-inc.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=32) (without sensors). The other one is called
[Universal Photo Timer](http://www.universaltimer.com/), and it costs
[$165](http://www.universaltimer.com/buy_now.html#UPT_KIT1A) (again, without sensors). (Later, I became aware of a
[$325](https://bmumford.securewebsites.com/OrderCamSecure.html) [Time Machine](http://www.bmumford.com/photo/camctlr.html)
and Kapture Group's [Toolbox](http://www.kapturegroup.com/main_htmls/toolbox.html) that starts at $2,095!)

That seemed to me to be too much for the few times I might use it. So I decided to find out what would it take to
interface some sensors and triggers to a computer somehow, and just do it myself.

For a time, I though of connecting a sensor instead of a mouse button. I'd need to convert an analog signal from the
sensor to digital ("yes" or "no") with a [comparator](http://home.cogeco.ca/~rpaisley4/ATDetIR.html), and read the mouse
events in the computer... All this is doable, but not elegant nor flexible.

Then, I found [Phidgets](http://www.phidgets.com/), who sell I/O boards and sensors that connect to them. They enjoy
good reputation for quality-built products. Their basic I/O board costs [$80](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&amp;product_id=1018),
which is still a little too much, but I was almost ready to go for it.

And then I did a Google search for "I/O board", and the first two links were to Arduino. At first, I did not understand
why. But then (on April 27th, 2010) I realized that Arduino *is* an extendable I/O board with a micro-controller And on
May 4th, a very trustworthy source ([Dan's Data](http://www.dansdata.com/)) published the pro-micro-controller
[piece](http://www.dansdata.com/gz104.htm)...

### Interfacing ###

Arduino provides analog-to-digital converters (on the micro-controller chip itself), so there is no need for
comparators: comparison with the threshold is done in software! Of course, there are digital inputs also, so buttons can
be read directly in software.

Digital-to-analog converters are also provided, as are digital outputs. LEDs can be made to blink (and their brightness
controlled). Stepper motors can be made to turn and relays to close.

Arduino is an I/O board: it facilitates interfacing of sensors and effectors to a computer. But the devices are not
connected directly (through memory-mapped ports and such). Instead, computer is interfaced (through a USB port) with the
micro-controller on the Arduino board. This micro-controller  in turn, is interfaced with the sensors etc. This
roundabout way of interfacing means that for a computer to be able to talk to the sensors and effectors, a program
("a sketch") has to be uploaded into the micro-controller.

One way to write this program would be to define commands using which the computer would read the sensors and trigger
the effectors. With this approach, the computer is running a tight poll loop, wasting resources. Also, since
communications channel between the computer and the Arduino board is relatively slow (serial over USB), the polling
cycle may be too long.

An alternative way is to do polling on the micro-controller itself, and only send notifications of changes to the
computer. This approach saves both resources of the computer and the bandwidth of the connection. It is the approach
taken by the Firmata [project](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page) and its [protocol](http://firmata.org/wiki/Protocol).

Surprisingly, there is no standard Java binding for Firmata (as far as I know). I did not like the sample
[floating around](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Interfacing/Arduino.java.txt): it is, in my opinion,
insufficiently object-oriented and unnecessarily tied to Processing. So, I did the usual: wrote my own Java
[binding for Firmata](https://github.com/dubinsky/podval-firmata).

**Note:** Some [say](http://www.robotroom.com/Comparator.html) that if the comparator is used together with the
micro-controller it is "only interrupted when the digital signal changes", and does not need "to spend most of its time
reading the phototransistor's voltage in order to detect a passing line or mark", but I do not yet understand how that
works :( Maybe it is time to read some documentation on the micro-controller used by Arduino...

### Embeddability ###

Since the board has a micro-controller it is possible to program it so that the project behaves as designed without the
connection to the computer. Instead of the specialized schematics of the earlier days of electronics, a general-purpose
device is given its purpose through firmware. This way, modifications are much cheaper and easier.

Of course, it would be nice to be able to program an embedded board in Java. Indeed, single-board computers that run
Linux and Java are available - for instance, [this one](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&amp;product_id=1070)
from Phidgets is very nice. It costs $265. Also, there is [BeagleBoard](http://beagleboard.org/) for $150. Arduino board,
on the other hand, has to be programmed in single-threaded simplified C++. But it costs $30.

And if embedding an $30 board in a project is not feasible, there are cheaper Arduino boards specifically designed to be
embedded. Also, there are ways to build an Arduino-equivalent board (with some space for expansion) for
[$8](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/05/how-to_perfboard_hackduino.html)!

### Connectivity ###

Contemporary micro-controller-based devices are also very connectable.

It is possible to connect an Arduino board to an Ethernet network.

Bluetooth connectivity is available. Some robotics projects use an Android phone as part of the robot, and use Bluetooth
as connection mechanism. ([Others](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/05/cellbot_runs_on_internal_battery.html) use
the standard cable for data transfer *and power :)*)

There is also a very appealing radio module: XBee, a [ZigBee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee) implementation. This
relatively cheap device helps connect Arduinos to one another, and to the main computer. Or - to
[remotely program](http://www.ladyada.net/make/xbee/arduino.html) an embedded board. Since XBee itself has a
micro-controller on chip, in [some](http://www.ladyada.net/make/tweetawatt/), even an Arduino is not required!

### Photo Triggers ###

Of course, after I realized that Arduino can be used to trigger my camera, I found an article from the (excellent)
[Make magazine](http://makezine.com/) that describes such a device. I subscribe to Make, so I have that issue. And I
even have bookmarked the article when I first read it!

Here is a *selection* of photo triggers, timers and intervalometers using Arduino:
- [Laser trigger](http://photocritic.org/camera-laser-trigger/) from [Photocritic.org](http://photocritic.org/)
- [Arduino Intervalometer](http://openmoco.org/node/88) from OpenMoco.org (Open Source Photographic Motion-Control)
- [Camera Axe](http://www.glacialwanderer.com/hobbyrobotics/?p=325) from [Hobby Robotics](http://www.glacialwanderer.com/hobbyrobotics/)

An interesting text on [remote triggers](http://www.diyhappy.com/building-camera-triggers/)
([pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.wiley.com%2Fproduct_data%2Fexcerpt%2F19%2F07645965%2F0764596519.pdf)).

### General Electronics Books and Resources ###

Although a lot of circuitry that was necessary previously is supplanted by the Arduino board, some interfacing issues
remain, and basic knowledge of electronics is unavoidable. I mean questions like those:
- How do you calculate the [value](http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz) of the
  [current-limiting](http://led.linear1.org/why-do-i-need-a-resistor-with-an-led/)
  [resistor](http://www.doctronics.co.uk/resistor.htm)> for an LED?
- When do you need a [pull-up resistor](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/218) and how big?
- When do you use an [optoisolator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator) and how?
- What can you turn on directly? When a transistor is required? A relay?

I found some books that can help.

[Building Wireless Sensor Networks: with ZigBee, XBee, Arduino, and Processing](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Wireless-Sensor-Networks-Processing/dp/0596807732)
by Robert Faludi. For about 10 years, I read about many O'Reilly books that they are sloppily edited,
uncharacteristically for O'Reilly. I think it is time to admit that sloppy editing *is* characteristic for O'Reilly :)
This one also suffers from sloppy editing, bad structuring and condescending jokes. Nevertheless, there is enough
crucial information in the book to justify both the price and the unpleasantness. Just do not expect to enjoy the
process of absorbing the information :)

### Where to Buy ###

There many suppliers of electronics parts. The biggest and most popular are: [DigiKey](http://www.digikey.com/),
[Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/), [Jameco](http://www.jameco.com/), [Newark](http://www.newark.com/). So big and popular
they are, in fact, that there are [tools](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/05/how-to_sort_by_price_on_digikey.html)
that help you find cheapest part when it is made by multiple manufacturers!

There are quite a few places that supply parts for Arduino (and similar) Open-Source Hardware designs. For instance:
[SparkFun Electronics](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php),
[AdaFruit Industries](http://www.adafruit.com/), [Liquidware](http://www.liquidware.com/).
